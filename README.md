# let-it-bee
  Final project at Flatiron School.
LettBee is a tool for professional or hobbyists Beekeepers to remotely track vital information from multiple beehives in multiple places, all from their phone or computer. Using calibrated sensors an apiarist can track hive humidity, temperature and local weather. LetItBee allows its users to have a powerful advantage in monitoring hive health and seasonal development, spotting potentially devastating problems before they happen.

  LetItBee was built with React frontend and a Node.js backend that successfully integrates with a Tessel2 board and a humidity and temperature sensor. The backend persists live data from the sensors, live weather information from an external API and comments/notes logged by the user and related to the given beehive. With all this information we are able to visualize a nice and informative graph of each beehive, as well as monitor live data collected from the sensors. LetItBee will also display tips and advices for the beekeeper, based on each hive's conditions.
  
 LetItBee's extra features are in development phase, and the system is going to be tested with real beehives soon.
